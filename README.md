# Lyrics

A currently CLI-only application that outputs song lyrics into the terminal. The objective of this app is to generate a giftable card/letter that plays music (connecting to spotify), generates lyrics in time with the music being played, and lets users customize mesages to send to a favorite person. This app is written in python, but may include more programming languages for the UI. It is a work in progress.
